README
======
this document is designed to get people acquainted with computers!

contents: curl, >,
whoami, pwd, history, ls, cd, mkdir, rmdir,
touch, cat, tac, echo, vim, vimtutor, rm,
htop, cal, firefox, grep, shutdown

TO BEGIN
========

you're probably reading this in a github browsing window. lame!
you can grab a fresh file using this command:

curl URL > computers.txt

where the URL in this case would be
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
justinthomaschun/examples/main/computers.txt

the curl command transfers file data directly into the terminal.

the > here takes the output of the previous command and
writes it to the file computers.txt. you could call that file
derp.420 if you want to. it just isn't helpful.

WAIT, WHO AND WHERE ARE WE?
===========================

if you're on the command line following along (please do),
you can answer the who question using this command:

whoami

you can answer the where question using this command:

pwd

(this is short for Print Working Directory).
you can also check out previous commands using:

history

so basically you are a user, inspecting a directory.
you can list the contents of your directory using

ls DIR

and change the current directory to one of the ones in ls using

cd DIR

and make a new directory using

mkdir DIR

and remove an empty directory using

rmdir DIR

the thing to remember about unix is that EVERYTHING IS A FILE,
and directories are just files that can contain other files.
you're always on some node in a tree of directories.

FILES
=====

you can create a file using:

touch FILE

you can print the contents of a file using:

cat FILE

you can print the contents backwards (last line first) using:

tac FILE

you can print a string of characters to the terminal using:

echo STR

chaining these together, you can make an arbitrary file using:

echo "this string of characters is important!" > important.txt

in order to edit files, use vim. if you are unfamiliar, try:

vimtutor

you can remove a file using:

rm FILE

BONUS CONTENT
=============

you can see everything going on in your computer using:

htop

you can get a helpful six month calendar using:

cal -n 6

nowadays, you can use a web browser for media:

firefox IMPORTANT-IMAGE.jpg

you can search through large files using

ls FILE | grep "STR"

the | pipes the output from ls into the input for grep.

finally, if your permissions are set up correctly, this should work:

shutdown now
